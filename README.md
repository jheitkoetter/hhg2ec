# hhg2ec

The hhg2ec is the former faq document of comp.ai.genetic (see Google groups), posted between 1992 and 2001
to what was then called a Newsgroup.

To time-warp the Guide into an updated 21st century version, we were using Google code to host the Guide's
"code", which is a set of text files that form a dokuwiki, to allow everyone to run the hhg2ec on their
dokuwiki USB drive, while making modifications to then check them back into the master.
With the termination of Google code platform in 2015, we moved the code to GitHub.

If you want to read this guide, follow these 3 steps:

0. If you have a dokuwiki running created a new namespace "hhg2ec" and copy the files into that names space
(directory)

Otherwise:

1. Download DokuWiKi on a Stick and unpack to a USB stick
2. Create folder "hhg2ec" in /dokuwiki/data/pages
3. Download the files into the hhg2ec directory

Then fire up your favourite web browser and point it to

http://localhost/dokuwiki/hhg2ec/

Have fun, -joke
