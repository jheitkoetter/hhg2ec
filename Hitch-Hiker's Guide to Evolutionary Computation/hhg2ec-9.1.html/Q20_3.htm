<P> The European ESPRIT III project PAPAGENA is pleased to announce the availability of the
following book and software:
<P> <I>Parallel Genetic Algorithms: Theory and Applications</I> was recently published by
IOS press. The book, edited by Joachim Stender, provides an overview of the theoretical, as well as
practical, aspects involved in the study and implementation of parallel

(PGAs).
<P> The book comes with a floppy disk version of GAME (Genetic Algorithm Manipulation Environment).
For more information see the section on GAME in <A href=Q20_2.htm>Q20.2</A>.

PeGAsuS:</A></H2>
<P> PeGAsuS is a general programming environment for evolutionary algorithms.  developed at the
German National Research Center for Computer Science.  Written in ANSI-C, it runs on MIMD parallel
machines, such as transputers, and  distributed  systems, as well as serial machines.
<P> The  Library  contains

a  collection  of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FITNESS">FITNESS</A></font>
functions, and input/output and control procedures.  It provides the user with  a  number  of
validated modules. Currently, PeGAsuS can be compiled with the GNU C, RS/6000 C, ACE-C, and
Alliant's FX/2800 C compilers.  It runs on SUNs and RS/6000 workstations, as well as on the Alliant
FX/28.  PeGAsuS is not available to the public.
