<H1>The ZEN Puzzle</H1>
<P> For some weird reason this guide contains some puzzles which can only be solved by cautious
readers who have (1) a certain amount of a certain kind of humor, (2) a certain amount of patience
and time, (3) a certain amount of experience in
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_Z.htm#ZEN NAVIGATION">ZEN NAVIGATION</A>,</font>
and (4) a certain amount of books of a certain author.
<P> Usually, puzzles search either for certain answers (more often, ONE answer) to a question; or,
for the real smartasses, sometimes an answer is presented, and a certain question is searched for.
ZEN puzzles are even more challenging: you have to come up with an answer to a question, both of
which are not <I>explicitly</I>, rather <I>implicitly</I> stated somewhere in this
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FAQ">FAQ</A>.</font>
Thus, you are expected to give an answer AND a question!
<P> To give an impression <I>what this is all about</I>, consider the following, submitted by
<I>Craig W. Reynolds.</I> The correct question is: "Why is Fisher's `improbability quote' (cf
<A href="epilogue.htm"> EPILOGUE
</A> ) included in this FAQ?", Craig's correct answer is: <I>`This is a GREAT quotation, it sounds
like something directly out of a</I> <I>turn of the century Douglas Adams: Natural Selection:
</I> <I> the original "Infinite Improbability Drive"'</I> Got the message? Well, this was easy and
very obvious. The other puzzles are more challenging...
<P> However, all this is just for fun (mine and hopefully yours), there is nothing like the $100
price, some big shots in computer science, e.g.  <I>Don Knuth</I> usually offer; all there is
but a honorable mentioning of the ZEN navigator, including the puzzle s/he solved. It's thus like in
real life: don't expect to make money from your time being a scientist, it's all just for the fun of
it...
<P> Enjoy the trip!
