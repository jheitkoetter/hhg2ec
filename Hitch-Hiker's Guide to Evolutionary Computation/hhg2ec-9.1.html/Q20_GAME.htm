<P> GAME (GA Manipulation Environment) aims to demonstrate GA applications and build a suitable
programming
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A>.</font>
<P> GAME is being developed as part of the <font size=2>PAPAGENA</font> project of the
European Community's Esprit III initiative.
<P> GAME is available as an addendum to a book on PGAs (cf PAPAGENA, <A href=Q20_3.htm>Q20.3</A>).  And from the project's

server
<A href="ftp://bells.cs.ucl.ac.uk/papagena/" >ftp://bells.cs.ucl.ac.uk/papagena/</A> e.g.
"papagena/game/docs" contains all the papers that have been produced over the course of the GAME
project.  The sources can also be obtained by FTP see <B>papagena/game/version2.01/</B>
<P> GAME is now in version 2.01. This version is still able to run only sequential
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A>s,</font>
but version 3.0 will handle parallel GAs as well.
<P> Unfortunately, The project yet only produced a Borland C++ 3.x version, so far.  It is intended
to distribute a version for UNIX/GNU C++ as well, when some compatibility issues concerning C++
"standards" have been resolved. Afterward a UNIX version will be released, but this will be only
happen after the release of PC version 3.0.
