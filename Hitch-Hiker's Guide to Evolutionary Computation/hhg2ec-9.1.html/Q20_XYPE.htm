<P> XYpe (The
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A></font>
Engine) is a commercial GA application and development package for the Apple Macintosh. Its standard
user interface allows you to design
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CHROMOSOME">CHROMOSOME</A>s,</font>
set attributes of the genetic engine and graphically display its progress. The development package
provides a set of Think C libraries and include files for the design of new GA applications. XYpe
supports adaptive operator weights and mixtures of alpha, binary, gray, ordering and real number
codings.
<P> The price of $725 (in Massachusetts add 5% sales tax) plus $15 shipping and handling includes
technical support and three documentation manuals.  XYpe requires a Macintosh SE or newer with 2MB
RAM running OS V6.0.4 or greater, and Think C if using the development package.
<P> Currently the GA engine is working; the user interface will be completed on demand. Interested
parties should contact: Ed Swartz, Virtual Image, Inc., 75 Sandy Pond Road #11, Ayer, MA 01432, USA.
