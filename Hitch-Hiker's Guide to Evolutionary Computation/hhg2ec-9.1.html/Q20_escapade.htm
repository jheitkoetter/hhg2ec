<P> ESCaPaDE is a sophisticated software environment to run experiments with
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM">EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM</A>s,</font>
such as e.g. an
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTION STRATEGY">EVOLUTION STRATEGY</A>.</font>
The main support for experimental work is provided by two internal tables: (1) a table of objective
functions and (2) a table of so-called data monitors, which allow easy implementation of functions
for monitoring all types of information inside the Evolutionary Algorithm under experiment.
<P> ESCaPaDE 1.2 comes with the KORR implementation of the evolution strategy by H.-P. Schwefel
which offers simple and correlated
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_M.htm#MUTATION">MUTATION</A>s.</font>
KORR is provided as a FORTRAN 77 subroutine, and its cross-compiled C version is used internally by
ESCaPaDE.
<P> An extended version of the package was used for several investigations so far and has proven to
be very reliable. The software and its documentation is fully copyrighted although it may be freely
used for scientific work; it requires 5-6 MB of disk space.
