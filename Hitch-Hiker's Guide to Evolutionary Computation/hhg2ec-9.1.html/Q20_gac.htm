written in C. GAL is my Common Lisp version. They are similar in spirit to John Grefenstette's
Genesis, but they don't have all the nice bells and whistles. Both versions currently run on Sun
workstations. If you have something else, you might need to do a little modification.
<P> Both versions are free: All I ask is that I be credited when it is appropriate. Also, I would
appreciate hearing about improvements! This software is the property of the US Department of the
Navy.
<P> The code will be in a "shar" format that will be easy to install. This code is "as is", however.
There is a README and some documentation in the code. There is NO user's guide, though (nor am I
planning on writing one at this time). I am interested in hearing about bugs, but I may not get
around to fixing them for a while. Also, I will be unable to answer many questions about the code,
or about GAs in general. This is not due to a lack of interest, but due to a lack of free time!
