GANNET:</A></H2>
<P> GANNET (Genetic Algorithm / Neural NETwork) is a software package written by Jason Spofford in
1990 which allows one to evolve binary valued neural networks. It offers a variety of configuration
options related to rates of the

GANNET evolves nets based upon three
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FITNESS">FITNESS</A></font>
functions:  Input/Output Accuracy, Output 'Stability', and Network Size.
<P> The evolved neural network presently has a binary input and binary output format, with neurodes
that have either 2 or 4 inputs and weights ranging from -3 to +4.  GANNET allows for up to 250
neurons in a net. Research using GANNET is continuing.
<P> GANNET 2.0 is available at
<A href="http://www.duane.com/~dduane/gannet" >http://www.duane.com/~dduane/gannet</A>
 . As well as the software, the masters thesis that utilized this program as well as a paper is
available in this directory.
<P> The major enhancement of version 2.0 is the ability to recognize variable length binary strings,
such as those that would be generated by a finite automaton.  Included is code for calculating the
Effective Measure Complexity (EMC) of finite automata as well as code for generating test data.
<P> A mailing list has been established for discussing uses and problems with the GANNET software.
