<H1><A href=Q98.htm>Q98</A>: Are there any patents on EAs?</H1>
<P>
<P> Process patents have been issued both for the Bucket Brigade Algorithm in
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CLASSIFIER SYSTEM">CLASSIFIER SYSTEM</A>s:</font>
U.S. patent #4,697,242: J.H. Holland and A. Burks, "Adaptive computing system capable of learning
and discovery", 1985, issued Sept 29 1987; and for

U.S. patent #4,935,877 (to John Koza).
<P> This
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FAQ">FAQ</A></font>
does not attempt to provide legal advice. However, use of the Lisp code in the book <A
href="Q10_2.htm#:KOZA92">[KOZA92]</a> is freely licensed for academic use. Although those wishing to
make commercial use of any process should obviously consult any patent holders in question, it is
pretty clear that it's not in anyone's best interests to stifle GA/GP research and/or development.
Commercial licenses much like those used for CAD software can presumably be obtained for the use of
these processes where necessary.
<P> Jarmo Alander's massive bibliography of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A>s</font>
(see <A href=Q10_8.htm>Q10.8</A>) includes a (probably) complete list of all currently know patents.  There is also a
periodic posting on <A href=news:comp.ai.neural-nets >comp.ai.neural-nets</A> by Gregory Aharonian
<A href="mailto:srctran@world.std.com">&lt;srctran@world.std.com&gt;</A> about patents on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
