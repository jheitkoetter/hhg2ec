<h1>The HTML Translation Project</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This guide has traditionally been available in two formats: plain text, digest format (distributed
to the <A href=news:comp.ai.genetic >comp.ai.genetic</A> and <A href=news:comp.answers
>comp.answers</A>
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_U.htm#USENET">USENET</A></font>
newsgroups), and Postscript format, available by
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FTP">FTP</A></font>
from various sources (notably
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#ENCORE">ENCORE</A></font>
- see <A href=Q15_3.htm>Q15.3</A>).
<P> It has long been an aim of the authors of this guide that it should be availble in HTML format
too, and readily accessible on the World Wide Web. Tom Fine, in
<a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet-faqs/html/">
Ohio</a>, has done a very good job of providing a site which contains many
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FAQ">FAQ</A>s,</font>
converted into HTML format. However, while this conversion pulls out main links (e.g. to FTP and
HTTP sites), it does not always produce useful links within the contents of the FAQ.
<P> Converting the whole of this guide into HTML code would be an enormous task (which is why we put
it off for so long!) But in November 1995 we began this translation project.  We devised ways in
which the original source for the guide (which happens to be in <I>troff</I> format) could be
converted to HTML automatically. This means that we can still generate the plain text and Postscript
versions of the FAQ just the same as before, but we can generate this HTML version too - all from
the same basic (<I>troff</I>) source.
<P>

<h2>What's Included?</h2>

The HTML version of the FAQ includes the following features:
<UL><LI> Links to glossary entries, e.g.
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTION">EVOLUTION</A>.</font>
<LI> Links to other questions, e.g <A href=Q15_1.htm>Q15.1</A>.
<LI> Links to FTP and HTTP sites.
<LI> Links to Email addresses.
<LI> Links to newsgroups e.g.  <A href=news:comp.ai.genetic >comp.ai.genetic</A>
<LI> Cross references to book details, e.g.  <A href="Q12.htm#:ICGA85">[ICGA85]</a>
<LI> Bulleted lists.
<LI> Links between software entries in <A href=Q20.htm>Q20</A> and the corresponding detailed entry in <A href=Q20_1.htm>Q20.1</A> or <A href=Q20_2.htm>Q20.2</A>.
(Added June 1999)
</UL> Furthermore, when the FAQ was originally written, by
J&ouml;rg Heitk&ouml;tter, a lot of control codes for <B>bold</B> and <I>italic</I> were included.
These looked very nice in the Postscript version, but those people who only ever read the plain text
version didn't get to see the FAQ in its full glory. Now, though, the HTML version converts these
codes into the appropriate HTML codes, for your enhanced viewing pleasure!

<h2>What's Not Included?</h2>

You wont find lots of fancy images in here. This project has concentrated on producing a good HTML
representation of an existing "paper" document.  The development effort on this project has gone
into adding <I>functionality</I> to the guide, not  flashy images, which mostly serve to slow down
loading.  The intention is that anyone who sees this version of the guide will immediately recognise
it as another version of the existing Hitch Hiker's Guide to Evolutionary Computation.
<P>

However, there is still more work to be done.  A number of things have yet to be converted for the
HTML version. For example, more precise paragraph formatting.
<P> These are projects for some other time ...
