<H1>PREFACE</H1>
<P> This guide is intended to help, provide basic information, and serve as a first straw for
individuals, i.e.  uninitiated <I>hitch-hikers</I>, who are stranded in the mindboggling universe of
<I>Evolutionary Computation</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_E.htm#EC">EC</A>);</font>
that in turn is only a small footpath to an even more mindboggling scientific universe, that,
incorporating <I>Fuzzy Systems,</I> and <I>Artificial Neural Networks,</I> is
sometimes referred to as <I>Computational Intelligence</I> (CI); that in turn is only part
of an even more advanced scientific universe of mindparalysing complexity, that incorporating
<I>Artificial Life,</I> <I>Fractal Geometry,</I> and other <I>Complex Systems
Sciences</I> might someday be referred to as <I>Natural Computation</I> (NC).
<P> Over the course of the past years,
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION">GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION</A></font>
algorithms imitating certain principles of nature have proved their usefulness in various domains of
applications. Especially worth copying are those principles where nature has found "stable islands"
in a "turbulent ocean" of solution possibilities. Such phenomena can be found in annealing
processes, central nervous systems and biological
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTION">EVOLUTION</A>,</font>
which in turn have lead to the following
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_O.htm#OPTIMIZATION">OPTIMIZATION</A></font>
methods: <I>Simulated Annealing</I> (SA), <I>Artificial Neural Networks</I> (ANNs) and
the field of <I>Evolutionary Computation</I> (EC).
<P> EC may currently be characterized by the following pathways: <I>Genetic Algorithms</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A>),</font>
<I>Evolutionary Programming</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_E.htm#EP">EP</A>),</font>
<I>Evolution Strategies</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_E.htm#ES">ES</A>),</font>
<I>Classifier Systems</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_C.htm#CFS">CFS</A>),</font>
<I>Genetic Programming</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_G.htm#GP">GP</A>),</font>
and several other problem solving strategies, that are based upon biological observations, that date
back to Charles Darwin's discoveries in the 19th century: the means of <I>natural selection
</I> and the <I>survival of the fittest,</I> and theories of evolution.  The inspired
algorithms are thus termed <I>Evolutionary Algorithms</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_E.htm#EA">EA</A>).</font>
<P> Moreover, this guide is intended to help those who are just beginning to read the <A
href=news:comp.ai.genetic >comp.ai.genetic</A> newsgroup, and those who are new "on"
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_U.htm#USENET">USENET</A>.</font>
It shall help to avoid lengthy discussions of questions that usually arise for beginners of one or
the other kind, and which are boring to read again and again by <A href=news:comp.ai.genetic
>comp.ai.genetic</A> "old-timers."
<P> You will see this guide popping up periodically in the Usenet newsgroup <A
href=news:comp.ai.genetic >comp.ai.genetic</A> (and also <A href=news:comp.answers >comp.answers</A>
, and <A href=news:news.answers >news.answers</A> , where it should be locatable at any time).

<H1>ORIGIN</H1>
<P> This guide was produced by
<a href="backpage.htm"> J&ouml;rg Heitk&ouml;tter
</a> (known as <I>Joke</I>) in early 1993, using material from many sources (see
<a href="credits.htm"> Acknowledgements
</a> ), mixed with his own brand of humour. Towards the end of 1993, J&ouml;rg handed over editorial
responsibility to
<a href="backpage.htm"> David Beasley
</a> . He reorganised the guide in various ways, and generally attempted to inject his own brand of
orderliness. Thus, any jokes are the work of <I>Joke</I>. The mundane bits are David's
responsibility.
<P> The guide is kept up to date, as far as possible, and new versions are issued several times a
year. However, we do rely on useful information being sent to us for inclusion in the guide (we dont
always have time to read <A href=news:comp.ai.genetic >comp.ai.genetic</A> , for example).
Contributions, additions, corrections, cash, etc. are therefore always welcome.  Send e-mail to the
address at the beginning of the guide.
<P>

This WWW version of the FAQ is
the result of a <a href=project.htm>project</a>
to translate the original text version to HTML.
We hope you dont encounter any <a href=mistakes.htm>problems</a>,
as you are reading, but if you do, we apologise for the inconvenience.
