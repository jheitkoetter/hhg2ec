<P> CFS-C 1.0 is a domain independent collection of

routines written by Rick L. Riolo <A href="mailto:rlr@merit.edu">&lt;rlr@merit.edu&gt;</A> as part of his PhD dissertation.  A
completely rewritten CFS-C is planned for 1994/95; this may include the features of CFS-C 2.0
mentioned in <A href="Q12.htm#:SAB90">[SAB90]</a> (e.g. "latent learning") or they may be included
in a separate package released in 1995.  An ANSIfied version of CFS-C 1.0 (CFS-C 1.98j) is available
by

<P> CFS-C is available from
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#ENCORE">ENCORE</A></font>
(See <A href=Q15_3.htm>Q15.3</A>) in file: <B>CFS/src/cfsc-1.98j.tar.gz</B> and includes the original 1.02 CFS-C
in its "cfsc/orig" folder after unpacking. On the "SyS" FTP server its:
<A href="ftp://lumpi.informatik.uni-dortmund.de/pub/LCS/src/cfsc-1.98j.tar.gz"
>ftp://lumpi.informatik.uni-dortmund.de/pub/LCS/src/cfsc-1.98j.tar.gz</A> with documentation in
<B>/pub/LCS/docs/cfsc.ps.gz</B>
<P> Another version of CFS-C (version XV 0.1) by Jens Engel &lt;engel@asterix.irb.uni-
hannover.de&gt; is also available. This includes bug fixes of earlier versions, allowing it to run
on a wider range of machines (e.g. Linux and nCUBE). It also has an XView front end that makes it
easier to control, and some extensions to the algorithms.  It is available from Encore in file:
<B>CFS/src/cfscxv-0.1.tar.gz</B> with documentation in <B>CFS/docs/cfscxv-0.1.readme.gz
