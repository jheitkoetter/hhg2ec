<P> This guide is big. Really big. You just won't believe how hugely, vastly, mindbogglingly big it
is. That's why it has been split into a "trilogy" -- which, like all successful trilogies,
eventually ends up consisting of more than three parts.


<H2><A NAME="Searching for answers">
Searching for answers</A></H2>
<P> To find the answer of question number <I>x</I>, just search for the string "Q<I>x</I>:". (So the
answer to question 42 is at "<A href=Q42.htm>Q42</A>:"!)
In this WWW version of the guide, all you need to do is to click
on the link.

<H2><A NAME="What does [xxxx99] mean?">
What does [xxxx99] mean?</A></H2>
<P> Some books are referenced again and again, that's why they have this kind of "tag", that an
experienced <I>hitch-hiker</I> will search for in the list of books (see <A href=Q10.htm>Q10</A> and <A href=Q12.htm>Q12</A> and other
places) to dissolve the riddle. Here, they have a ":" appended, thus you can search for the string
"<A href="Q12.htm#:ICGA85">[ICGA85]</a>:" for example.
In this WWW version of the guide, all you need to do is to click

<H2><A NAME="Why all this UPPERCASING in running text?">
Why all this UPPERCASING in running text?</A></H2>
<P> Words written in all uppercase letters are cross-references to entries in the <I>Glossary</I>
(see <A href=Q99.htm>Q99</A>). Again, they have a ":" appended, thus if you find, say
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTION">EVOLUTION</A>,</font>
you can search for the string "EVOLUTION:" in the <I>Glossary</I>.

<H2><A NAME="FTP and HTTP naming conventions">
FTP and HTTP naming conventions</A></H2>
<P> A file available on an
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FTP">FTP</A></font>
server will be specified as: <B>&lt;ftp-site-name&gt;/&lt;the-complete-filename&gt;</B> So
for example, the file <B>bar.tar.gz</B> in the directory <B>/pub/foo</B> on the ftp
server <B>ftp.certain.site</B> would be specified as: <B>ftp.certain.site/pub/foo/bar.tar.gz
</B>
<P> A specification ending with a "/" is a reference to a whole directory, e.g.
<B>ftp.certain.site/pub/foo/</B>
<P> HTTP files are specified in a similar way, but with the prefix: <B>http://</B>
