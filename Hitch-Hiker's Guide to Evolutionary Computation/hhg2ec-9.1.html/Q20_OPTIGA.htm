<P> optiGA for VB is an ActiveX control (OCX) for the implementation of

It is described by the author, Elad Salomons, as follows:
<P> No matter what the nature of your
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_O.htm#OPTIMIZATION">OPTIMIZATION</A></font>
problem might be, optiGA is a generic control that will perform the genetic run for you.  With very
little coding needed, you can be up and running in no time.  Just define your variables (binary,
real or integers), code the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FITNESS">FITNESS</A></font>
function and you are set to go. On the other hand, you can override optiGA's default parameters and
select from several of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_R.htm#REPRODUCTION OPERATOR">REPRODUCTION OPERATOR</A>s</font>
such as:
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_S.htm#SELECTION">SELECTION</A></font>
methods,
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CROSSOVER">CROSSOVER</A></font>
methods,
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_M.htm#MUTATION">MUTATION</A></font>
methods and many controlling parameters.
<P> If that isn't enough, optiGA can grow with you: Did you come up with a new crossover method and
wanted to try it?  Have you read the latest article about an interesting mutation method that you
want to implement? No problem!  Just use the "User Defined" crossover and mutation events and code
them yourself.
<P> optiGA was written in "Visual Basic" and can be used with VB and all supporting
