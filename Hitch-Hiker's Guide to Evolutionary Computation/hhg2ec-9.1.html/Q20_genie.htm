<P> Genie is a GA-based modeling/forecasting system that is used for long-term planning. One can
construct a model of an
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A></font>
and then view the forecasts of how that environment will evolve into the future. It is then possible
to alter the future picture of the environment so as to construct a picture of a desired future (I
will not enter into arguments of who is or should be responsible for designing a desired or better
future). The
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A></font>
is then employed to suggest changes to the existing environment so as to cause the desired future to
come about.
