<H1>EPILOGUE</H1>
<P> <P align=right>

"Natural selection is a mechanism for generating <I> an exceedingly high degree of
improbability."</I>
<P> <P align=right>

     --- Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962)

<P align=right>

<P> <I>This is a GREAT quotation, it sounds like something directly out of a</I> <I>turn of the
century Douglas Adams:</I> <I>Natural selection:</I> <I>the original "Infinite Improbability
Drive"</I>
<P> <P align=right>

     --- Craig Reynolds (1993), on reading the previous quote

<P> <I>`The Babel fish,' said The Hitch Hiker's Guide  to  the  Galaxy</I>  <I>quietly,  `is  small,
yellow  and  leech-like,  and  probably the oddest</I> <I>thing in the Universe.</I>
<I>It feeds on brainwave energy received not from his own  carrier  but</I>  <I>from  those
around  it.  It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies</I> <I>from this brainwave energy
to nourish itself with.</I> <I>It then excretes into the mind of its  carrier  a  telepathic
matrix</I>  <I>formed  by  combining  the  conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals
</I> <I>picked up from the speech centers of the brain which has supplied them.</I>  <I>The
practical  upshot  of  all this is that if you stick a Babel fish</I> <I>in your ear you can
instantly understand anything said to you  in  any</I>  <I>form  of  language.  The  speech
patterns  you  actually hear decode the</I> <I>brainwave matrix which has been fed into your
mind by your Babel</I> <I>fish.</I>  <I>`Now  it  is  such  a  bizarrely  improbable
coincidence  than  anything</I>  <I>so  mindbogglingly  useful could have evolved purely by
chance that</I> <I>some thinkers have chosen to see  it  as  a  final  and  clinching  proof
</I>  <I>of  the</I>non-<I>existence  of  God.</I>  <I>`The argument goes something like this: ``I
refuse to prove that I</I> <I>exist,'' says God, ``for proof denies faith, and without faith
I</I> <I>am nothing.''</I> <I>``But,'' says Man, ``The Babel fish is a dead giveaway
isn't it?</I> <I>It could  not  have  evolved  by  chance.  It  proves  you  exist,  and  so
</I>  <I>therefore,  by  your own arguments, you don't. QED.''</I> <I>``Oh dear,'' says God,
``I hadn't thought of that,'' and promptly</I> <I>vanishes in a puff of  logic.</I>
<I>``Oh,  that was easy,'' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove</I> <I>that black is
white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.</I>

     --- Douglas Adams (1979)

<P> "Well, people; I really wish this thingie to turn into a <I>paper babel-fish</I> for  all
those  young  ape-descended  organic  life forms on this crazy planet, who don't have any clue about
what's going on in this exciting "new" research field, called
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION">EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION</A>.</font>
However, this is just a start, I need your help to increase the usefulness of this guide, especially
its  readability for natively English speaking folks; whatever it is: I'd like to hear from you...!"
<P> <P align=right>

     --- The Editor, J&ouml;rg Heitk&ouml;tter (1993)

<P align=right>

<P> "Parents of young organic life forms should be warned, that
 <I>paper babel-fishes</I> can be harmful, if stuck too deep into the ear."
