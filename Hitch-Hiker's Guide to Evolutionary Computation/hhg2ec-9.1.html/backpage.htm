<H1>ABOUT THE EDITORS</H1>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="J&ouml;rg Heitk&ouml;tter,">
J&ouml;rg Heitk&ouml;tter,</A></H2>
was born in 1965 in Recklinghausen, a small but beautiful 750 year old town at the northern rim of
the Ruhrgebiet, Germany's coal mining and steel belt.  He was educated at Hittorf-Gymnasium,
Recklinghausen, Ruhruniversit&auml;t Bochum <font size=2>(RUB)</font> and Universit&auml;t
Dortmund <font size=2>(UNIDO),</font> where he read <I>theoretical medicine, psychology,
biology, philosophy</I> and (for whatever reason) <I>computer sciences.</I>
<P> He volunteered as a <font size=2>RA</font> in the <I>Biomathematics Research Group
</I> from 1987 to 1989, at the former ``Max-Planck-Institute for Nutrition Physiology,'' in Dortmund
(since March 1, 1993 renamed to ``MPI for Molecular Physiology''), and spent 3 years at the
``Systems Analysis Research Group,'' at the Department of Computer Science of UniDO, where he wrote
a particularly unsuccesful thesis on
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_L.htm#LEARNING CLASSIFIER SYSTEM">LEARNING CLASSIFIER SYSTEM</A>s.</font>
In 1995, after 22 semesters, he finally gave up trying to break <I>Chris Langton's</I>
semester record, and dropped out of the academic circus. Amazingly, he's the R&amp;D and Security
manager of UUNET Deutschland GmbH, currently working on various interesting things in parallel.  You
may visit his homepage for a mostly complete list at
<A href="http://alife.santafe.edu/~joke/" >http://alife.santafe.edu/~joke/</A> or
<A href="http://surf.de.uu.net/people/joke" >http://surf.de.uu.net/people/joke</A>
<P> His electronic publications range from a voluntary job as senior editor of the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FAQ">FAQ</A></font>
in Usenet's <A href=news:comp.ai.genetic >comp.ai.genetic</A> newsgroup, entitled <I>The Hitch-
Hiker's Guide to Evolutionary Computation,</I> over many other projects he helped
bootstrapping, for example Howard Gutowitz' FAQ on Cellular Automata, available on
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_U.htm#USENET">USENET</A></font>
via <A href=news:comp.theory.cell-automata >comp.theory.cell-automata</A> ,to about a dozen of so-
called ``multimediagrams'' written in HTML, the language that builds the World-Wide Web. The most
useful ones being
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#ENCORE">ENCORE</A>,</font>
the Evolutionary Computation Repository Network that today, after several years of weekend hacking,
is accessible world-wide. And the latest additions: Zooland, the definite collection of pointers to
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_A.htm#ARTIFICIAL LIFE">ARTIFICIAL LIFE</A></font>
resources on the 'net.
<P> With Adam Gaffin, a former senior newspaper reporter from Middlesex News, Boston, MA, who is now
with Networks World, he edited the most read book on Internet, that was launched by a joined venture
of Mitch Kapor's Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Apple Computer Library, initially
called <I>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet</I> it was later renamed to <I>EFF's (Extended) Guide
to the Internet: A round trip</I> <I>through Global Networks, Life in Cyberspace, and
Everything...</I>
<A href="http://www.eff.org/" >http://www.eff.org/</A>
<P> Since a very special event, he has severe problems to take life seriously, and consequently
started signing everything with ``-joke'', while developing a liquid fixation on all flavours of
whiskey. He continues to write short stories, novels and works on a diary-like lyrics collection of
questionable content, entitled <I>A Pocketful of Eloquence,</I> which recently was remaned to
<I>Heartland,</I> and published on the web as:
<A href="http://surf.de.uu.net/heartland/" >http://surf.de.uu.net/heartland/</A>
<P> He likes <I>Mickey Rourke's</I> movies (especially Rumblefish and Barfly), <I>Edmund
Spenser's</I> medieval poetry, the music of <font size=2>QUEEN,</font> <font
size=2>KANSAS,</font> and <font size=2>MARILLION,</font> McDonald's Hamburgers,
diving into the analysis of complex systems of any kind, (but prefers the long-legged ones) and the
books by <I>Erasmus of Rotterdam,</I> <I>Robert Sheckley, Alexei Panshin,</I> and, you
name it, <I>Douglas Adams.</I>
<P> Due to circumstances he lead a life on the edge, until he finally found the perfect match, which
has changed many things drammatically: he is not single anymore, and now has his first child (he
definitely knows of); on 28 January 2000 Daniel Tobias H. jumped into this world. He even got
married on November 5th 1999. If you like this kind of stuff, have a look at the wedding pictures at
<A href="http://surf.de.uu.net/people/joke/wedding/" >http://surf.de.uu.net/people/joke/wedding/</A>
<P> Well, so far so good. He is still known to reject job offers that come bundled with Porsches and
still doesn't own a <font size=2>BMW Z3</font> roadster, for he recently purchased a red 1996
Ford Probe Medici, enjoying life at 230 kph, while listening to the formidable 1975 <font
size=2>KANSAS</font> song <I>``Born On Wings Of Steel.''</I>
<P> He still doesn't live in Surrey, but in Dortmund in a knight's castle, which was build in the
16th century and rebuild in the early 90ies.  The building with its tower, park and pond is known as
<I>Rittergut ``Haus S&ouml;lde''.</I>

<H2><A NAME="David Beasley,">
David Beasley,</A></H2>
was born in London, England in 1961. He was educated at Southampton University where he read (for
good reasons) Electronic Engineering.
<P> After spending several years at sea, he went to the Department of Computing Mathematics of the
University of Wales, Cardiff, where he studied
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_A.htm#ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</A></font>
for a year. He then went on to write a thesis on
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A>s</font>
applied to Digital Signal Processing, and tried to break <I>Joke's</I> publications record.
<P> Since a very special event, he has taken over writing this
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FAQ">FAQ</A>,</font>
and consequently started signing everything with ``The FAQmaster'' (He's had severe problems taking
life seriously for some time before that, however.) He likes <I>Woody Allen's</I> movies,
English clothing of medieval times, especially <I>Marks and Spencer,</I> hates McDonald's
Hamburgers, but occasionally dives into the analysis of complex systems of any kind, (but prefers
those with pedals and handlebars) and the books by (of course) <I>Douglas Adams.</I>
<P> He is not married, has no children, and also also doesn't live in Surrey.
<P> He spent several years working for a (mostly interesting) software company, Praxis in Bath,
England. He left after it became clear that the new owners, Deloitte and Touche, had no interest in
software engineering.  He now works for ingenta, a company which provides on-line access to learned
publications and other on-line services to academic users around the world. This includes the long-
established BIDS reference services.  ingenta (
<A href="http://www.ingenta.com/" >http://www.ingenta.com/</A> ) are based at Bath University,
England.
