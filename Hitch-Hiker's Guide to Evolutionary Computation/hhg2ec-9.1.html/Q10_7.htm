<P> Adams, D. with Carwardine M. (1990) "Last Chance to see...", London: Heinemann. [David Corne: I
strongly suggest you read this. Its a report on visits to various parts of the world to see
endangered species. It is remarkably and wonderfully funny and illuminating.  It would actually be a
good reference to have in any bit of the FAQ to do with genetic diversity and/or the lack of it, or
the remarkable kinds of adaptations that can occur for the strangest reasons.]

is <I>not.</I> Further information from

<P> There is a *lot* of interesting material on biology and evolution in the <A
href=news:talk.origins >talk.origins</A> newsgroup repository, available by FTP. The index of files,
available from
<A href="ftp://ics.uci.edu/pub/origins/Index" >ftp://ics.uci.edu/pub/origins/Index</A> , lists
what's there, and includes files on Darwinism, definition of evolution, introduction to evolutionary
biology, a list of important FAQ files, speciation,  and genetic drift.
