<H3><A NAME= "ZEN NAVIGATION" > ZEN NAVIGATION:</A></H3> A methodology with a tremendous propensity
to get lost during a <I>hike</I> from A to B.  Zen Navigation simply consists of finding something
that looks as if it knows where it is going, and following it.  The results are often more
surprising than successful, but its usually worth using for the sake of the few occasions when it is
both.

<P>
 Sometimes Zen Navigation is referred to as "<I>doing scientific research,</I>" where A is a state
of mind considered as being pre-PhD, and B is a (usually a different) state of mind, known as post-
PhD.  Your time spent in state C, somewhere inbetween A and B, is usually referred to as "<I>being a
nobody.</I>"
