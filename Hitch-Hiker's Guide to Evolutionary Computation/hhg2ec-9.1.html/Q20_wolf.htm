<P> This is a simulator for the G/SPLINES (genetic spline models) algorithm which builds spline-
based functional models of experimental data, using

and

to evolve a
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_P.htm#POPULATION">POPULATION</A></font>
towards a better fit. It is derived from Friedman's MARS models. The original work was presented at
ICGA-4, and further results including additional basis function types such as B-splines have been
presented at the NIPS-91 meeting.

this machine no longer allows anonymous ftp access, so you</I> <I>wont be able to get it

noncommercial use. Simulator includes executable and C source code; a technical report (RIACS tech
report 91.10) is also available.
