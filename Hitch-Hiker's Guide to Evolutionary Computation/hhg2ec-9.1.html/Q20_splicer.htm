Splicer:</A></H2>
<P> Splicer is a
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC ALGORITHM">GENETIC ALGORITHM</A></font>
tool created by the Software Technology Branch (STB) of the Information Systems Directorate at
NASA/Johnson Space Center with support from the MITRE Corporation. Splicer has well-defined
interfaces between a
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A></font>
kernel, representation libraries,
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FITNESS">FITNESS</A></font>
modules, and user interface libraries.
<P> The representation libraries contain functions for defining, creating, and decoding genetic
strings, as well as multiple
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CROSSOVER">CROSSOVER</A></font>
and
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_M.htm#MUTATION">MUTATION</A></font>
operators. Libraries supporting binary strings and permutations are provided, others can be created
by the user.
<P> Fitness modules are typically written by the user, although some sample applications are
provided. The modules may contain a fitness function, initial values for various control parameters,
and a function which graphically displays the best solutions.
<P> Splicer provides event-driven graphic user interface libraries for the Macintosh and the X11
window system (using the HP widget set); a menu-driven ASCII interface is also available though not
fully supported.  The extensive documentation includes a reference manual and a user's manual; an
architecture manual and the advanced programmer's manual are currently being written.
<P> An electronic bulletin board (300/1200/2400 baud, 8N1) with information regarding Splicer can be
reached at (713) 280-3896 or (713) 280-3892.  Splicer is available free to NASA and its contractors
for use on government projects by calling the STB Help Desk weekdays 9am-4pm CST at (713) 280-2233.
Government contractors should have their contract monitor call the STB Help Desk; others may
purchase Splicer for $221 (incl. documentation) from: COSMIC, 382 E. Broad St., Athens, GA 30602,
USA.  (Unverified 8/94).  Last known address <A href="mailto:bayer@galileo.jsc.nasa.gov">&lt;bayer@galileo.jsc.nasa.gov&gt;</A> (Steve Bayer). This
now bounces back with "user unknown".
