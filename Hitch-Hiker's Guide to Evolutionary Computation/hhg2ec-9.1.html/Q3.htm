<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION">EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION</A></font>
attracts researchers and people of quite dissimilar disciplines, i.e.
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EC">EC</A></font>
is a interdisciplinary research field:
<P>

<H2><A NAME="Computer scientists">
Computer scientists</A></H2>
<P> Want to find out about the properties of sub-symbolic information processing with
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EA">EA</A>s</font>
and about learning, i.e.  adaptive systems in general.
<P> They also build the hardware necessary to enable future EAs (precursors are already beginning to
emerge) to huge real world problems, i.e. the term "massively parallel computation" <A
href="Q10_4.htm#:HILLIS92">[HILLIS92]</a>, springs to mind.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="Engineers">
Engineers</A></H2>
<P> Of many kinds want to exploit the capabilities of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EA">EA</A>s</font>
on many areas to solve their application, esp.
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_O.htm#OPTIMIZATION">OPTIMIZATION</A></font>
problems.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="Roboticists">
Roboticists</A></H2>
<P> Want to build
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_M.htm#MOBOT">MOBOT</A>s</font>
(MOBile
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_R.htm#ROBOT">ROBOT</A>s,</font>
i.e. R2D2's and #5's cousins) that navigate through uncertain
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A>s,</font>
without using built-in "maps".  The MOBOTS thus have to adapt to their surroundings, and learn what
they can do "move-through-door" and what they can't "move-through-wall" on their own by "trial-and-
error".
<P>

<H2><A NAME="Cognitive scientists">
Cognitive scientists</A></H2>
<P> Might view
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CFS">CFS</A></font>
as a possible apparatus to describe models of thinking and cognitive systems.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="Physicists">
Physicists</A></H2>
<P> Use
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EC">EC</A></font>
hardware, e.g. Hillis' (Thinking Machine Corp.'s) Connection Machine to model real world problems
which include thousands of variables, that run "naturally" in parallel, and thus can be modelled
more easily and esp.  "faster" on a parallel machine, than on a serial "PC" one.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="Biologists">
Biologists</A></H2>
<P> Are finding
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EA">EA</A>s</font>
useful when it comes to protein folding and other such bio-computational problems (see <A href=Q2.htm>Q2</A>).
<P> EAs can also be used to model the behaviour of <I>real</I>
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_P.htm#POPULATION">POPULATION</A>s</font>
of organisms.  Some biologists are hostile to modeling, but an entire community of <I>Population
Biologists</I> arose with the 'evolutionary synthesis' of the 1930's created by the polymaths
R.A. Fisher, J.B.S.  Haldane, and S. Wright.  Wright's
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_S.htm#SELECTION">SELECTION</A></font>
in small populations, thereby avoiding local optima) is of current interest to both biologists and
ECers -- populations are naturally parallel.
<P> A good exposition of current population Biology modeling is J. Maynard Smith's text
<I>Evolutionary Genetics.</I> Richard Dawkin's <I>Selfish Gene</I> and <I>Extended
Phenotype</I> are unparalleled <I>(sic!)</I> prose expositions of evolutionary processes.  Rob
Collins' papers are excellent parallel
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A></font>
models of evolutionary processes (available in <A href="Q12.htm#:ICGA91">[ICGA91]</a> and by
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FTP">FTP</A></font>
from
<A href="ftp://ftp.cognet.ucla.edu/pub/alife/papers/"
>ftp://ftp.cognet.ucla.edu/pub/alife/papers/</A> ).
<P> As fundamental motivation, consider Fisher's comment: <I>"No practical biologist interested in
(e.g.) sexual</I>
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_R.htm#REPRODUCTION">REPRODUCTION</A></font>
<I>would be led to work out the detailed consequences experienced by</I> <I>organisms having
three or more sexes; yet what else should [s/]he</I> <I>do if [s/]he wishes to understand
why the sexes are, in fact, always</I> <I> two?"</I> (Three sexes would make for even
weirder grammar, [s/]he said...)
<P>

<H2><A NAME="Chemists">
Chemists</A></H2>
<P> And in particular biochemists and molecular chemists, are interested in problems such as the
conformational analysis of molecular clusters and related problems in molecular sciences.  The
application of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A>s</font>
to molecular systems has opened an interesting area of research and the number of chemists involved
in it increases day-by-day.
<P> Some typical research topics include:

<UL>  <P> <LI> protein folding; <LI> conformational analysis and energy minimization; <LI> docking
      algorithms for drug-design; <LI> solvent site prediction in macromolecules;
</UL> Several papers have been published in journals such as <I>Journal of Computational Chemistry
</I> and <I>Journal of Computer-Aided Design.</I>
<P> Some interesting WWW sites related to the applications of GAs to chemistry (or molecular science
in general) include:
<P>

<UL>  <P> <LI>
      <A href="http://garage.cps.msu.edu/projects/biochem/biochem.html"
      >http://garage.cps.msu.edu/projects/biochem/biochem.html</A> about GAs in biochemistry (water
      site prediction, drug-design and protein folding); <LI>
      <A href="http://www.tc.cornell.edu/Edu/SPUR/SPUR94/Main/John.html"
      >http://www.tc.cornell.edu/Edu/SPUR/SPUR94/Main/John.html</A> about the application of GAs to
      the search of conformational energy minima; <LI>
      <A href="http://cmp.ameslab.gov/cmp/CMP_Theory/gsa/gen2.html"
      >http://cmp.ameslab.gov/cmp/CMP_Theory/gsa/gen2.html</A> By using a GA in combiation with a
      Tight-binding model, David Deaven and Kai-Ming Ho founded fullerene cages (including C60)
      starting from random coordinates.
