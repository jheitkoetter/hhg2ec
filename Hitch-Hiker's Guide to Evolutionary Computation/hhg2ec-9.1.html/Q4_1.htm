<H1><A href=Q4_1.htm>Q4.1</A>: What about Alife systems, like Tierra and VENUS?</H1>
<P>
<P> None of these are

but all of them use the evolutionary metaphor as their "playing field".

<P> Synthetic organisms have been created based on a computer metaphor of organic life in which CPU
time is the ``energy'' resource and memory is the ``material'' resource.  Memory is organized into
informational patterns that exploit CPU time for self-replication.
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_M.htm#MUTATION">MUTATION</A></font>
generates new forms, and
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTION">EVOLUTION</A></font>
proceeds by natural
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_S.htm#SELECTION">SELECTION</A></font>
as different
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENOTYPE">GENOTYPE</A>s</font>
compete for CPU time and memory space.
<P> Observation of nature shows that evolution by natural selection is capable of both
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_O.htm#OPTIMIZATION">OPTIMIZATION</A></font>
and creativity.  Artificial models of evolution have demonstrated the optimizing ability of
evolution, as exemplified by the field of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC ALGORITHM">GENETIC ALGORITHM</A>s.</font>
The creative aspects of evolution have been more elusive to model.  The difficulty derives in part
from a tendency of models to specify the meaning of the ``genome'' of the evolving entities,
precluding new meanings from emerging.  I will present a natural model of evolution demonstrating
both optimization and creativity, in which the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENOME">GENOME</A></font>
consists of sequences of executable machine code.
<P> From a single rudimentary ancestral ``creature'', very quickly there evolve parasites, which are
not able to replicate in isolation because they lack a large portion of the genome.  However, these
parasites search for the missing information, and if they locate it in a nearby creature, parasitize
the information from the neighboring genome, thereby effecting their own replication.
<P> In some runs, hosts evolve immunity to attack by parasites.  When immune hosts appear, they
often increase in frequency, devastating the parasite
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_P.htm#POPULATION">POPULATION</A>s.</font>
In some runs where the community comes to be dominated by immune hosts, parasites evolve that are
resistant to immunity.
<P> Hosts sometimes evolve a response to parasites that goes beyond immunity, to actual
(facultative) hyper-parasitism.  The hyper-parasite deceives the parasite causing the parasite to
devote its energetic resources to replication of the hyper-parastie genome.  This drives the
parasites to extinction.  Evolving in the absence of parasites, hyper-parasites completely dominate
the community, resulting in a relatively uniform community characterized by a high degree of
relationship between
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_I.htm#INDIVIDUAL">INDIVIDUAL</A>s.</font>
Under these circumstances, sociality evolves, in the form of creatures which can only replicate in
aggregations.
<P> The cooperative behavior of the social hyper-parasites makes them vulnerable to a new class of
parasites.  These cheaters, hyper-hyper-parasites, insert themselves between cooperating social
individuals, deceiving the social creatures, causing them to replicate the genomes of the cheaters.
<P> The only genetic change imposed on the simulator is random bit flips in the machine code of the
creatures.  However, it turns out that parasites are very sloppy replicators.  They cause
significant
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_R.htm#RECOMBINATION">RECOMBINATION</A></font>
and rearrangement of the genomes.  This spontaneous sexuality is a powerful force for evolutionary
change in the system.
<P> One of the most interesting aspects of this instance of life is that the bulk of the evolution
is based on adaptation to the biotic
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A></font>
rather than the physical environment.  It is co-evolution that drives the system.

VENUS</A></H2>
<P> Steen Rasmussen's (et al.) VENUS I+II "coreworlds" as described in <A
href="Q12.htm#:ALIFEII">[ALIFEII]</a> and <A href="Q10_1.htm#:LEVY92">[LEVY92]</a>, are inspired by
A.K. Dewdney's well-known article (Dewdney 1984). Dewdney proposed a game called "Core Wars", in
which hackers create computer programs that battle for control of a computer's "core" memory (Strack
93).  Since computer programs are just patterns of information, a successful program in core wars is
one that replicates its pattern within the memory, so that eventually most of the memory contains
its pattern rather than that of the competing program.
<P> VENUS is a modification of Core Wars in which the Computer programs can mutate, thus the pseudo
assembler code creatures of VENUS evolve steadily. Furthermore each memory location is endowed with
"resources" which, like sunshine are added at a steady state.  A program must have sufficient
resources in the regions of memory it occupies in order to execute.  The input of resources
determines whether the VENUS ecosystem is a "jungle" or a "desert."  In jungle

III technical paper have now been added to the directory.  These should be directly printable from
most machines.  Because some unix systems' "lpr" commands cannot handle very large files (ours at
least), I have split the paper into Yaeger.ALife3.1.ps and Yaeger.ALife3.2.ps.  These files can be
ftp-ed in "ascii" mode.  For unix users I have also included compressed versions of both these files
(indicated by the .Z suffix), but have left the uncompressed versions around for people connecting
from non-unix systems.  I have not generated PostScript versions of the images, because they are
color and the resulting files are much too large to store, retrieve, or print.  Accordingly, though
I have removed a Word-formatted version of the textual body of the paper that used to be here, I
have left a Word-formatted version of the color images.  If you wish to acquire it, you will need to
use the binary transfer mode to move it to first your unix host and then to a Macintosh (unless Word
on a PC can read it - I don't know), and you may need to do something nasty like use ResEdit to set
the file type and creator to match those of a standard Word document (Type = WDBN, Creator = MSWD).
