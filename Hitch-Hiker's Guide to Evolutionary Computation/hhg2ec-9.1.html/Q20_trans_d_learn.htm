program (shareware).  TDL allows users to perform pattern recognition by utilizing software that
allows for fast, automatic construction of Neural Networks, mostly alleviating the need for
parameter tuning.  Evolutionary processes combined with semi-weighted networks (hybrid cross between
standard weighted neurons and weightless n-level threshold units) generally yield very compact
networks (i.e., reduced connections and hidden units). By supporting multi-shot learning over
standard one-shot learning, multiple data sets (characterized by varying input and output
dimensions) can be learned incrementally, resulting in a single coherent network.  This can also
lead to significant improvements in predictive accuracy (Trans-dimensional generalization).
Graphical support and several data files are also provided.
