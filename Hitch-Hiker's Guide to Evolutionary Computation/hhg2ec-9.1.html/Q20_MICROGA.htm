MicroGA:</A></H2>
<P> MicroGA is a powerful and flexible new tool which allows programmers to integrate
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A>s</font>
into their software quickly and easily. It is an object-oriented C++ framework that comes with full
source code and documentation as well as three sample applications. Also included is the Galapagos
code generator which allows users to create complete applications interactively without writing any
C++ code, and a sample MacApp interface.
<P> MicroGA is available for Macintosh II or higher with MPW and a C++ compiler, and also in a
Microsoft Windows version for PC compatibles.  Compiled applications made with MicroGA can be sold
without license fee. MicroGA is priced at $249.
<P>
<P> <B>Galapagos</B> is a tool for use with Emergent Behavior's MicroGA Toolkit. It allows a
user to define a function and set of constraints for a problem that the user wants to solve using
the GA.  Galapagos then generates a complete C++ program using the information supplied. Then all
the user has to do is to compile these files, using either Turbo/Borland C++ (PC, MS Windows), or
MPW and C++ compiler (Macintosh), and link the resulting code to the MicroGA library. Then just run
the program. Galapagos comes free with every copy of MicroGA.

Palo Alto, CA 94306, USA.  Net: <A href="mailto:emergent@aol.com">&lt;emergent@aol.com&gt;</A>
<P> MicroGA is distributed in Germany by Optimum Software (cf EvoFrame &amp; REALizer entries).
