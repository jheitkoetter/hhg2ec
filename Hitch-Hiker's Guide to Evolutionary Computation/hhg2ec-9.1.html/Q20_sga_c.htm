<P> SGA-C is a C-language translation and extension of the original Pascal SGA code presented in
Goldberg's book <A href="Q10_2.htm#:GOLD89">[GOLD89]</a>. It has some additional features, but its
operation is essentially the same as that of the Pascal version. SGA-C is described in TCGA report
No. 91002.
<P> SGA-Cube is a C-language translation of Goldberg's SGA code with modifications to allow
execution on the nCUBE 2 Hypercube Parallel Computer.  When run on the nCUBE 2, SGA-Cube can take
advantage of the hypercube architecture, and is scalable to any hypercube dimension. The hypercube
implementation is modular, so that the algorithm for exploiting parallel processors can be easily
modified.
<P> In addition to its parallel capabilities, SGA-Cube can be compiled on various serial computers
via compile-time options. In fact, when compiled on a serial computer, SGA-Cube is essentially
identical to SGA-C.  SGA-Cube  is described in TCGA report No. 91005.
