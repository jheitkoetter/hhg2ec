<P> "Genitor is a modular
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A></font>
package containing examples for floating-point, integer, and binary representations. Its features
include many sequencing operators as well as subpopulation modeling.
<P> The Genitor Package has code for several order based
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CROSSOVER">CROSSOVER</A></font>
operators, as well as example code for doing some small

to optimality.
<P> We are planning to release a new and improved Genitor Package this summer (1993), but it will
mainly be additions to the current package that will include parallel island models, cellular GAs,
delta coding, perhaps CHC (depending on the legal issues) and some other things we have found
useful."
