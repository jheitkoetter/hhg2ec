<P>
<P>
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC PROGRAMMING">GENETIC PROGRAMMING</A></font>
is the extension of the genetic model of learning into the space of programs. That is, the objects
that constitute the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_P.htm#POPULATION">POPULATION</A></font>
are not fixed-length character strings that encode possible solutions to the problem at hand, they
are programs that, when executed, "are" the candidate solutions to the problem. These programs are
expressed in genetic programming as parse trees, rather than as lines of code.  Thus, for example,
the simple program "a + b * c" would be represented as:
<P>
<PRE>

	    +
	   / \
	   a  *
	    / \
	    b  c
</PRE>

<P> or, to be precise, as suitable data structures linked together to achieve this effect. Because
this is a very simple thing to do in the programming language Lisp, many GPers tend to use Lisp.
However, this is simply an implementation detail. There are straightforward methods to implement
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GP">GP</A></font>
using a non-Lisp programming environment.
<P> The programs in the population are composed of elements from the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FUNCTION SET">FUNCTION SET</A></font>
and the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_T.htm#TERMINAL SET">TERMINAL SET</A>,</font>
which are typically fixed sets of symbols selected to be appropriate to the solution of problems in
the domain of interest.
<P> In GP the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CROSSOVER">CROSSOVER</A></font>
operation is implemented by taking randomly selected subtrees in the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_I.htm#INDIVIDUAL">INDIVIDUAL</A>s</font>
(selected according to
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FITNESS">FITNESS</A>)</font>
and exchanging them.
<P> It should be pointed out that GP usually does not use any
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_M.htm#MUTATION">MUTATION</A></font>
as a
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC OPERATOR">GENETIC OPERATOR</A>.</font>
