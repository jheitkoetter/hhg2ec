<H2><A NAME="EnGENEer:">
EnGENEer:</A></H2>
<P> Logica Cambridge Ltd. developed EnGENEer as an in-house
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC ALGORITHM">GENETIC ALGORITHM</A></font>
environment to assist the development of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A></font>
applications on a wide range of domains. The software was written in C and runs under Unix as part
of a consultancy and systems package. It supports both interactive (X-Windows) and batch (command-
line) modes of operation.
<P> EnGENEer provides a number of flexible mechanisms which allow the developer to rapidly bring the
power of GAs to bear on new problem domains. Starting with the Genetic Description Language, the
developer can describe, at high level, the structure of the ``genetic material'' used. The language
supports discrete
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENE">GENE</A>s</font>
with user defined cardinality and includes features such as multiple
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CHROMOSOME">CHROMOSOME</A>s</font>
models, multiple
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_S.htm#SPECIES">SPECIES</A></font>
models and non-evolvable parsing symbols which can be used for decoding complex genetic material.
<P> The user also has available a descriptive high level language, the Evolutionary Model Language.
It allows the description of the GA type used in terms of configurable options including:
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_P.htm#POPULATION">POPULATION</A></font>
size, population structure and source,
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_S.htm#SELECTION">SELECTION</A></font>
method,

and
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_M.htm#MUTATION">MUTATION</A></font>
type and probability,
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_I.htm#INVERSION">INVERSION</A>,</font>
dispersal method, and number of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_O.htm#OFFSPRING">OFFSPRING</A></font>
per
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENERATION">GENERATION</A>.</font>
<P> Both the Genetic Description Language and the Evolutionary Model Language are fully supported
within the interactive interface (including online help system) and can be defined either "on the
fly" or loaded from audit files which are automatically created during a GA run.
<P> Monitoring of GA progress is provided via both graphical tools and automatic storage of results
(at user defined intervals). This allows the user to restart EnGENEer from any point in a run, by
loading both the population at that time and the evolutionary model that was being used.
<P> Connecting EnGENEer to different problem domains is achieved by specifying the name of the
program used to evaluate the problem specific
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FITNESS">FITNESS</A></font>
function and constructing a simple parsing routine to interpret the genetic material. A library of
standard interpretation routines are also provided for commonly used representation schemes such as
gray-coding, permutations, etc. The fitness evaluation can then be run as either a slave process to
the GA or via a standard handshaking routines. Better still, it can be run on either the machine
hosting the EnGENEer or on any sequential or parallel hardware capable of connecting to a Unix
machine.
