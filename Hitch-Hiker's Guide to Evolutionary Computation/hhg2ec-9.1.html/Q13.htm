<H3>ISGEC: International Society for Genetic and Evolutionary Computation</H3>
<P> Formed in late 1999 from the merger of the International Society for
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC ALGORITHM">GENETIC ALGORITHM</A>s</font>
(ISGA) and the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC PROGRAMMING">GENETIC PROGRAMMING</A></font>
Conference organization.  This society brings together the oldest society in the field of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION">EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION</A></font>
(ISGA) as well as the two largest conferences in the field.  The ISGEC should help bring a greater
sense of unity, order, and inclusiveness to the growing field of genetic and evolutionary
computation.
<P> The ISGEC embraces all facets of its growing field, including genetic algorithms, genetic
programming,
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTION STRATEGIE">EVOLUTION STRATEGIE</A>s,</font>
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMMING">EVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMMING</A>,</font>
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CLASSIFIER SYSTEM">CLASSIFIER SYSTEM</A>s,</font>
evolvable hardware, and emerging areas including (but not limited to) immune system learning,
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_D.htm#DNA">DNA</A></font>
and molecular computing, ant
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_O.htm#OPTIMIZATION">OPTIMIZATION</A>,</font>
evolutionary robotics, ECHO, Tierra, and genetic scheduling. The society and its annual GECCO
conference are dynamically structured so as to continuously and automatically embrace new directions
of research and new participants in the field.
<P> ISGEC is a formal membership society.  Special arrangements have been negotiated to provide the
two journals Evolutionary Computation and Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines to all members
as part of their membership.  Society members will also get a significant discount at society
conferences and workshops, such as GECCO and FOGA.

<H3>EvoNet</H3>
<P> EvoNet is a Europe wide network of evolutionary computing experts that supports research and
facilitates the transfer of knowledge from academia to industry. EvoNet is funded by the European
Union.
