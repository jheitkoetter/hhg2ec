<H1><A href=Q1.htm>Q1</A>: What are Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)?</H1>
<P>
<P> <I>Evolutionary algorithm</I> is an umbrella term used to describe computer-based problem
solving systems which use computational models of some of the known mechanisms of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTION">EVOLUTION</A></font>
as key elements in their design and implementation. A variety of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM">EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM</A>s</font>
have been proposed.  The major ones are:
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC ALGORITHM">GENETIC ALGORITHM</A>s</font>
(see <A href=Q1_1.htm>Q1.1</A>),
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMMING">EVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMMING</A></font>
(see <A href=Q1_2.htm>Q1.2</A>),
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTION STRATEGIE">EVOLUTION STRATEGIE</A>s</font>
(see <A href=Q1_3.htm>Q1.3</A>),
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CLASSIFIER SYSTEM">CLASSIFIER SYSTEM</A>s</font>
(see <A href=Q1_4.htm>Q1.4</A>), and
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC PROGRAMMING">GENETIC PROGRAMMING</A></font>
(see <A href=Q1_5.htm>Q1.5</A>). They all share a common conceptual base of simulating the evolution of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_I.htm#INDIVIDUAL">INDIVIDUAL</A></font>
structures via processes of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_S.htm#SELECTION">SELECTION</A>,</font>
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_M.htm#MUTATION">MUTATION</A>,</font>
and
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_R.htm#REPRODUCTION">REPRODUCTION</A>.</font>
The processes depend on the perceived
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_P.htm#PERFORMANCE">PERFORMANCE</A></font>
of the individual structures as defined by an
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A>.</font>
<P> More precisely,
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EA">EA</A>s</font>
maintain a
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_P.htm#POPULATION">POPULATION</A></font>
of structures, that evolve according to rules of selection and other operators, that are referred to
as "search operators", (or
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC OPERATOR">GENETIC OPERATOR</A>s),</font>
such as
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_R.htm#RECOMBINATION">RECOMBINATION</A></font>
and mutation. Each individual in the population receives a measure of its
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FITNESS">FITNESS</A></font>
in the environment. Reproduction focuses attention on high fitness individuals, thus exploiting (cf.
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EXPLOITATION">EXPLOITATION</A>)</font>
the available fitness information.  Recombination and mutation perturb those individuals, providing
general heuristics for
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EXPLORATION">EXPLORATION</A>.</font>
Although simplistic from a biologist's viewpoint, these algorithms are sufficiently complex to
provide robust and powerful adaptive search mechanisms.

<H2><A NAME="BIOLOGICAL BASIS">
BIOLOGICAL BASIS</A></H2>
<P> To understand
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EA">EA</A>s,</font>
it is necessary to have some appreciation of the biological processes on which they are based.
<P> Firstly, we should note that
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTION">EVOLUTION</A></font>
(in nature or anywhere else) is not a purposive or directed process.  That is, there is no evidence
to support the assertion that the goal of evolution is to produce Mankind. Indeed, the processes of
nature seem to boil down to a haphazard
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENERATION">GENERATION</A></font>
of biologically diverse organisms.  Some of evolution is determined by natural
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_S.htm#SELECTION">SELECTION</A></font>
or different
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_I.htm#INDIVIDUAL">INDIVIDUAL</A>s</font>
competing for resources in the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A>.</font>
Some are better than others. Those that are better are more likely to survive and propagate their
genetic material.
<P> In nature, we see that the encoding for genetic information
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_G.htm#GENOME">GENOME</A>)</font>
is done in a way that admits asexual
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_R.htm#REPRODUCTION">REPRODUCTION</A>.</font>
Asexual reproduction typically results in
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_O.htm#OFFSPRING">OFFSPRING</A></font>
that are genetically identical to the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_P.htm#PARENT">PARENT</A>.</font>
(Large numbers of organisms reproduce asexually; this includes most bacteria which some biologists
hold to be the most successful
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_S.htm#SPECIES">SPECIES</A></font>
known.)
<P> Sexual reproduction allows some shuffing of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CHROMOSOME">CHROMOSOME</A>s,</font>
producing offspring that contain a combination of information from each parent.  At the molecular
level what occurs <I>(wild oversimplification alert!)</I> is that a pair of almost identical
chromosomes bump into one another, exchange chunks of genetic information and drift apart. This is
the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_R.htm#RECOMBINATION">RECOMBINATION</A></font>
operation, which is often referred to as
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CROSSOVER">CROSSOVER</A></font>
because of the way that biologists have observed strands of chromosomes crossing over during the
exchange.
<P> Recombination happens in an environment where the selection of who gets to mate is largely a
function of the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_F.htm#FITNESS">FITNESS</A></font>
of the individual, i.e. how good the individual is at competing in its environment. Some "luck"
(random effect) is usually involved too. Some EAs use a simple function of the fitness measure to
select individuals (probabilistically) to undergo genetic operations such as crossover or asexual
reproduction (the propagation of genetic material unaltered).  This is fitness-proportionate
selection.  Other implementations use a model in which certain randomly selected individuals in a
subgroup compete and the fittest is selected. This is called tournament selection and is the form of
selection we see in nature when stags rut to vie for the privilege of mating with a herd of hinds.
<P> Much EA research has assumed that the two processes that most contribute to evolution are
crossover and fitness based selection/reproduction.  Evolution, by definition, absolutely requires
diversity in order to work.  In nature, an important source of diversity is
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_M.htm#MUTATION">MUTATION</A>.</font>
In an EA, a large amount of diversity is usually introduced at the start of the algorithm, by
randomising the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENE">GENE</A>s</font>
in the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_P.htm#POPULATION">POPULATION</A>.</font>
The importance of mutation, which introduces further diversity while the algorithm is running,
therefore continues to be a matter of debate. Some refer to it as a background operator, simply
replacing some of the original diversity which may have been lost, while others view it as playing
the dominant role in the evolutionary process.
<P> It cannot be stressed too strongly that an
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM">EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM</A></font>
(as a
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_S.htm#SIMULATION">SIMULATION</A></font>
of a genetic process) is not a random search for a solution to a problem (highly fit individual).
EAs use stochastic processes, but the result is distinctly non-random (better than random).
