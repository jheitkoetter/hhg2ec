PGA:</A></H2>
<P> PGA is a simple testbed for basic explorations in
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC ALGORITHM">GENETIC ALGORITHM</A>s.</font>
Command line arguments control a range of parameters, there are a number of built-in problems for
the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A></font>
to solve. The current set includes:

<UL>  <P> <LI> maximize the number of bits set in a
      <font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CHROMOSOME">CHROMOSOME</A></font>

<P>   <LI> De Jong's functions DJ1, DJ2, DJ3, DJ5

<P>   <LI> binary F6, used by Schaffer et al

<P>   <LI> a crude 1-d knapsack problem; you specify a target and a set of numbers in an external
      file, GA tries to find a subset that sums as closely as possible to the target

<P>   <LI> the `royal road' function(s); a chromosome is regarded as a set of consecutive blocks of
      size K, and scores K for each block entirely filled with 1s, etc; a range of parameters.

<P>   <LI> max contiguous bits, you choose the
      <font size=-1> <A href="Q99_A.htm#ALLELE">ALLELE</A></font>
      range.

<P>   <LI> timetabling, with various smart
      <font size=-1> <A href="Q99_M.htm#MUTATION">MUTATION</A></font>
      options; capable of solving a good many real-world timetabling problems (has done so)
</UL>
<P> Lots of GA options: rank, roulette, tournament, marriage-tournament, spatially-structured
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_S.htm#SELECTION">SELECTION</A>;</font>
one-point, two-point, uniform or no
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_C.htm#CROSSOVER">CROSSOVER</A>;</font>
fixed or adaptive mutation; one child or two; etc.
<P> Default output is curses-based, with optional output to file; can be run non-interactively too
for batched series of experiments.
<P> It's easy to add your own problems. Chromosomes are represented as character arrays, so you are
not (quite) stuck with bit-string problem encodings.
<P> PGA has been used for teaching for a couple of years now, and has been used as a starting point
by a fair number of people for their own projects. So it's reasonably reliable. However, if you find
bugs, or have useful contributions to make, Tell Me! It is available by
