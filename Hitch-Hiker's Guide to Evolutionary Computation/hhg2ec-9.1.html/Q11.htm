<P> Along with the explosive growth of the computing industry has come the need to design systems
capable of functioning in complex, changing
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A>s.</font>
Considerable effort is underway to explore alternative approaches to designing more robust computer
systems capable of learning from and adapting to the environment in which they operate.
<P> One broad class of such techniques takes its inspiration from natural systems with particular
emphasis on evolutionary models of computation such as
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A>s,</font>

Until now, information on these techniques has been widely spread over numerous disciplines,
conferences, and journals.  [eds note: The editorial board reads like a who-is-who in

<H3>BioSystems</H3>
<P> Journal of Biological and Information Processing Sciences, Elsevier Science Publishers, P.O. Box
1527, 1000 BM Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
<P> BioSystems encourages experimental, computational, and theoretical articles that link biology,
evolutionary thinking, and the information processing sciences. The link areas form a circle that
encompasses the fundamental nature of biological information processing, computational modeling of
complex biological systems, evolutionary models of computation, the application of biological
principles to the design of novel computing systems, and the use of biomolecular materials to
synthesize artificial systems that capture essential principles of natural biological information
processing.
<P> Topics: Molecular

papers in
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION">EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION</A></font>
and related areas, with particular emphasis on the practical application of the techniques to
solving real problems in industry, medicine, and other disciplines.  Specific techniques include but

Papers emphasizing mathematical results should ideally seek to put these results in the context of
algorithm design, however purely theoretical papers will be considered.  Other papers in the areas
of cultural algorithms,
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_A.htm#ARTIFICIAL LIFE">ARTIFICIAL LIFE</A>,</font>
molecular computing, evolvable hardware, and the use of simulated evolution to gain a better
understanding of naturally evolved systems are also encouraged.
<P> Papers must conform to IEEE standard submission guidelines which are available in IEEE
transactions (for example, see the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks or the IEEE Transactions on
Fuzzy Systems). Those wanting to receive an author's information booklet from the IEEE can request
this at <A href="mailto:trans@ieee.org">&lt;trans@ieee.org&gt;</A>.

<H3>Complex Systems</H3>
<P> Published by: Complex Systems Publications, Inc., P.O. Box 6149, Champaign, IL 61821-8149, USA.
<P> Complex Systems devotes to the rapid publication of research on the science, mathematics, and
engineering of systems with simple components but complex overall behavior. Try finger(1) on

<H3>Machine Learning</H3>
<P> Published by: Kluwer Academic Publishers, P.O. Box 358, Accord Station, Hingham, MA 02018-0358
USA.
<P> Machine Learning is an international forum for research on computational approaches to learning.
The journal publishes articles reporting substantive research results on a wide range of learning
methods applied to a variety of task domains. The ideal paper will make a theoretical contribution
supported by a computer implementation.
<P> The journal has published many key papers in learning theory, reinforcement learning, and
decision tree methods.  The journal regularly publishes special issues devoted to
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A>s</font>

<H3>Adaptive Behavior</H3>
<P> Published quarterly by: MIT Press Journals, details above.
<P> Broadly, behavior is adaptive if it deals successfully with changes circumstances. For example,
when surprised, a hungry --but environmentally informed-- mouse may dart for cover rather than
another piece of cheese. Similarly, a tripped-up
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_R.htm#ROBOT">ROBOT</A></font>
[eds note: not necessarily built by Sirius Cybernetics Corp.]  could get back on its feet and
accomplish a moonrock-finding mission if it had learned to cope with unanticipated lunar potholes.
<P> <I>Adaptive Behavior</I> thus takes an approach complementary to traditional
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_A.htm#AI">AI</A>.</font>
Now basic abilities that allow animals to survive, or robots to perform their mission in
unpredictable
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_E.htm#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A>s,</font>
will be studied in preference to more elaborate and human-specific abilities.
<P> The journal also aims to investigate which new insights into intelligence and cognition can be
achieved by explicitly taking into account the environment feedback --mediated by behavior-- that an
animal or a robot receives, instead of studying components of intelligence in isolation.
<P> Topics:
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_I.htm#INDIVIDUAL">INDIVIDUAL</A></font>
and Collective Behavior. Neural Correlates of Behavior. Perception and Motor Control. Motivation and
Emotion.  Action

<H3>Artificial Life</H3>
<P> Published quarterly by: MIT Press Journals, details above.
<P> <I>Artificial Life</I> is intended to be the primary forum for the dissemination of
scientific and engineering research in the field of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_A.htm#ARTIFICIAL LIFE">ARTIFICIAL LIFE</A>.</font>
It will report on synthetic biological work being carried out in any and all media, from the
familiar "wetware" of organic chemistry, through the inorganic "hardware" of mobile robots, all the
way to the virtual "software" residing inside computers.
<P> Research topics ranging from the fabrication of self-replicating molecules to the study of
evolving
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_P.htm#POPULATION">POPULATION</A>s</font>
of computer programs will be included.
<P> There will also be occasional issues devoted to special topics, such as L-Systems,
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_G.htm#GENETIC ALGORITHM">GENETIC ALGORITHM</A>s,</font>
in-vitro evolution of molecules, artificial cells, computer viruses, and many social and
philosophical issues arising from the attempt to synthesize life artificially.

<H3>Evolutionary Economics</H3>
<P> Published quarterly by: Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., Service Center Secaucus, 44 Hartz Way,
Secaucus, NJ 07094, USA.  Tel: (201) 348-4033, Fax: (201) 348-4505.
<P> <I>Evolutionary Economics</I> aims to provide an international forum for a new approach
to economics.  Following the tradition of Joseph A. Schlumpeter, it is designed to focus on original
research with an evolutionary conception of the economy.  The journal will publish articles with
strong emphasis on dynamics, changing structures (including technologies, institutions, beliefs,
imitation, etc.).  It favors interdisciplinary analysis and is devoted to theoretical,
methodological and applied work.
<P> Research areas include: industrial dynamics; multi-sectoral and cross-country studies of
productivity; innovations and new technologies; dynamic competition and structural change in a
national and international context; causes and effects of technological, political and social
changes; cyclic processes in economic evolution; the role of governments in a dynamic world;
modeling complex dynamic economic systems; application of concepts, such as self-organization,
bifurcation, and chaos theory to economics; evolutionary games.
