<P>
<P> Digests are regulated, moderated, information sources in which many contributions are combined
together before being posted out to subscribers, usually on a regular basis (eg. weekly). Mailing
lists are listed in <A href=Q15_2.htm>Q15.2</A>.

moderated by Mitchell Potter and Annie Wu (formerly by Bill Spears).  The digest is also posted to
the <A href=news:comp.ai.genetic >comp.ai.genetic</A> newsgroup.
