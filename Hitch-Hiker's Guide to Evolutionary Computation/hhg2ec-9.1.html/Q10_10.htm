<H3>PTF for AI by CMU</H3>
<P> Carnegie Mellon University is establishing an Artificial Intelligence Repository to contain
public domain and freely distributable software, publications, and other materials of interest to AI
researchers, educators, and students. The AI Repository will be accessible by anonymous FTP and
Andrew File System (AFS) without charge (See <A href=Q15_3.htm>Q15.3</A>).  The contents of the repository will also be
published by Prime Time Freeware as an inexpensive mixed-media (Book/CD-ROM) publication.
<P> For your information, here is a precis of the CD-ROM:
<P> <I>PTF for AI is a periodic collection of AI-related source code and</I>
<I>documentation.  PTF for AI in no way modifies the legal restrictions</I> <I>on any

intelligence programming and research tools.  This ISO-9660 format CD-ROM contains thousands of
programs, source code collections, tutorials, research papers, Internet journals, and other
resources.  Previous versions of the AI CD-ROM are currently in use as teaching aids for AI-related
University courses, as research aids to computer scientists, and as a source of advanced computer
programming tools for application program developers around the world.
<P> The AI CD-ROM contains thousands of up to date files covering a wide range of topics including:
Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Expert Systems, Robotics, Machine Vision, Natural
Language, Prolog, Lisp, Embedded AI, Virtual Reality, Cellular Automata, Chaos, Fractals, and more.
