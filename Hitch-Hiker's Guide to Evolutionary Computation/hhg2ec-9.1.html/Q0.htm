<H1><A href=Q0.htm>Q0</A>: How about an introduction to comp.ai.genetic?</H1>
<P>
<P> Certainly. See below.
<P>

<H1>What is comp.ai.genetic all about?</H1>
<P> The newsgroup <A href=news:comp.ai.genetic >comp.ai.genetic</A> is intended as a forum for
people who want to use or explore the capabilities of <I>Genetic Algorithms</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_G.htm#GA">GA</A>),</font>
<I>Evolutionary Programming</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_E.htm#EP">EP</A>),</font>
<I>Evolution Strategies</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_E.htm#ES">ES</A>),</font>
<I>Classifier Systems</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_C.htm#CFS">CFS</A>),</font>
<I>Genetic Programming</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_G.htm#GP">GP</A>),</font>
and some other, less well-known problem solving algorithms that are more or less loosely coupled to
the field of <I>Evolutionary Computation</I>
<font size=-1> (<A href="Q99_E.htm#EC">EC</A>).</font>
<P>

<H1>How do I get started? What about USENET documentation?</H1>
<P> The following guidelines present the essentials of the
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_U.htm#USENET">USENET</A></font>
online documentation, that is posted each month to <A href=news:news.announce.newusers
>news.announce.newusers</A>
<P> If you are already familiar with "netiquette" you can skip to the end of this answer; if you
don't know <I>what the hell this is all about,</I> proceed as follows: (1) carefully read the
following paragraphs, (2) read all the documents in <A href=news:news.announce.newusers
>news.announce.newusers</A> before posting any article to USENET.  At least you should give the
introductory stuff a try, i.e. files "news-answers/introduction" and "news-answers/news-newusers-
intro". Both are survey articles, that provide a short and easy way to get an overview of the
interesting parts of the online docs, and thus can help to prevent you from drowning in the
megabytes to read. Both can be received either by subscribing to <A href=news:news.answers
>news.answers</A> , or sending the following message to <A href="mailto:mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu">&lt;mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu&gt;</A>:

<H1>Netiquette</H1>
<P>
					      <center>
<I>"Usenet is a convention, in every sense of the word."</I>
</center>
<P> Although
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_U.htm#USENET">USENET</A></font>
is usually characterized as "an anarchy, with no laws and no one in charge" there have "emerged"
several rules over the past years that shall facilitate <I>life</I> within newsgroups. Thus, you
will probably find the following types of articles:
<P>

<H2><A NAME="1. Requests">
1. Requests</A></H2>
Requests are articles of the form "I am looking for X" where X is something public like a book, an
article, a piece of software.
<P> If multiple different answers can be expected, the person making the request should prepare to
make a summary of the answers he/she got and announce to do so with a phrase like "Please e-mail,
I'll summarize" at the end of the posting.
<P> The Subject line of the posting should then be something like "Request: X"

<H2><A NAME="2. Questions">
2. Questions</A></H2>
As opposed to requests, questions are concerned with something so specific that general interest
cannot readily be assumed.  If the poster thinks that the topic is of some general interest, he/she
should announce a summary (see above).
<P> The Subject line of the posting should be something like "Question: this-and-that" (Q: this-and-
that) or have the form of a question (i.e., end with a question mark)

<H2><A NAME="3. Answers">
3. Answers</A></H2>
These are reactions to questions or requests.  As a rule of thumb articles of type "answer" should
be rare.  Ideally, in most cases either the answer is too specific to be of general interest (and
should thus be e-mailed to the poster) or a summary was announced with the question or request (and
answers should thus be e-mailed to the poster).
<P> The subject lines of answers are automatically adjusted by the news software.

<H2><A NAME="4. Summaries">
4. Summaries</A></H2>
In all cases of requests or questions the answers for which can be assumed to be of some general
interest, the poster of the request or question shall summarize the answers he/she received.  Such a
summary should be announced in the original posting of the question or request with a phrase like
"Please answer by e-mail, I'll summarize"
<P> In such a case answers should NOT be posted to the newsgroup but instead be mailed to the poster
who collects and reviews them.  After about 10 to 20 days from the original posting, its poster
should make the summary of answers and post it to the net.
<P> Some care should be invested into a summary:

<UL>  <P> a) simple concatenation of all the answers might not be enough; instead redundancies,
      irrelevances, verbosities and errors should be filtered out (as good as possible),

<P>   b) the answers shall be separated clearly

<P>   c) the contributors of the individual answers shall be identifiable unless they requested to
      remain anonymous [eds note: yes, that happens])

<P>   d) the summary shall start with the "quintessence" of the answers, as seen by the original
      poster

<P>   e) A summary should, when posted, clearly be indicated to be one by giving it a Subject line
      starting with "Summary:"
</UL>
<P> Note that a good summary is pure gold for the rest of the newsgroup community, so summary work
will be most appreciated by all of us.  <I>(Good summaries are more valuable</I> <I>than any
moderator!)</I>

<H2><A NAME="5. Announcements">
5. Announcements</A></H2>
Some articles never need any public reaction.  These are called announcements (for instance for a
workshop, conference or the availability of some technical report or software system).
<P> Announcements should be clearly indicated to be such by giving them a subject line of the form
"Announcement: this-and-that", or "ust "A: this-and-that".
<P> Due to common practice, conference announcements usually carry a "CFP:" in their subject line,
i.e. "call for papers" (or: "call for participation").


<H2><A NAME="6. Reports">
6. Reports</A></H2>
Sometimes people spontaneously want to report something to the newsgroup. This might be special
experiences with some software, results of own experiments or conceptual work, or especially
interesting information from somewhere else.
<P> Reports should be clearly indicated to be such by giving them a subject line of the form
"Report: this-and-that"
<H2><A NAME="7. Discussions">
7. Discussions</A></H2>
An especially valuable possibility of
<font size=-1> <A href="Q99_U.htm#USENET">USENET</A></font>
is of course that of discussing a certain topic with hundreds of potential participants.  All
traffic in the newsgroup that can not be subsumed under one of the above categories should belong to
a discussion.
<P> If somebody explicitly wants to start a discussion, he/she can do so by giving the posting a
subject line of the form "Start discussion: this-and-that" (People who react on this, please remove
the "Start discussion: " label from the subject line of your replies)
<P> It is quite difficult to keep a discussion from drifting into chaos, but, unfortunately, as many
other newsgroups show there seems to be no secure way to avoid this.  On the other hand, <A
href=news:comp.ai.genetic >comp.ai.genetic</A> has not had many problems with this effect, yet, so
let's just go and hope...
<P> Thanks in advance for your patience!
